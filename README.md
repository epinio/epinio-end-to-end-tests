# epinio-end-to-end-tests
This repository contains all the files necessary to run Epinio end-to-end tests.

In the cypress directory are stored the tests written using the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) testing framework. 

## Running the tests

It's expected that you have a Rancher instance installed and accessible by default.

Some environment variables must be set before running the test, mainly to target your Rancher instance:

|  Variable name | Description | Default |
|--|--|--|
| `RANCHER_USER`  | Rancher dashboard user | X |
| `RANCHER_PASSWORD`  | Rancher dashboard password | X |
| `RANCHER_URL`  | Rancher dashboard URL | `http://localhost:8005` |
| `CLUSTER_NAME`  | Cluster where you want Epinio installed | `local` |
| `SYSTEM_DOMAIN`  | Domain name for Epinio | X |


`make e2e-tests`

That's also possible to run Cypress in GUI mode (mandatory for developing new tests).</br>
As prerequisites, you need nodejs, yarn and a graphical environment.</br>
You can find more instructions about dependencies on the official [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress).</br>
Once requirements meet, run `make cypress-gui`.
